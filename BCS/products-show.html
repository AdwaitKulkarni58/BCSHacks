                    <h4>Plan B® usage</h4>
                    <p>Plan B® comes in a one-pill dose (levonorgestrel 1.5 mg). If taken within 72 hours (three days) and preferably within 12 hours of a contraceptive accident or unprotected sex, Plan B® can prevent pregnancy. Plan B® does not work if you are already pregnant (a fertilized egg has attached to the wall of the uterus). So if you take Plan B®, you will not be terminating a pregnancy.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h4>How often could one use Plan B®?</h4>
                    <p>Plan B® should only be used in emergencies and not on a regular basis. It can also be used more than once. However, if Plan B® is used on more than one occasion, the cumulative pregnancy rate will be higher.</p>
                    <p>Remember that it should never replace regular, long-term methods of contraception. The pregnancy rate of Plan B® is calculated for a single use. If Plan B® is used on more than one occasion, the cumulative pregnancy rate will be higher. Also, if Plan B® is taken more than once within a menstrual cycle, or taken once a month more than occasionally, it may impact your period.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h4>Most common Plan B® side effects</h4>
                    <p>Like all medications, Plan B® can cause some side effects:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Nausea: ~14% to 23% of women</li>
                      <li>Abdominal pain: ~18% of women</li>
                      <li>Fatigue: ~17% of women</li>
                      <li>Headache: ~17% of women</li>
                      <li>Dizziness: ~11% of women</li>
                      <li>Breast tenderness: ~11% of women</li>
                      <li>Vomiting: ~6% of women</li>
                      <li>Diarrhea: ~5% of women</li>
                      <li> Irregular menstrual bleeding: Some women may experience spotting after taking Plan B®. The majority of women will have their next menstrual period at the expected time or early. When Plan B® is used repeatedly (more than once in a menstrual cycle, or more than occasional once-a-month use), menstrual changes may occur, including a shorter or longer cycle and a heavier or lighter period than normal.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These side effects usually do not last more than 24 hours.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h4>How does Plan B® works?</h4>
                    <p>Plan B® is a levonorgestrel emergency contraceptive, available in a one-pill (1.5 mg) dose. It works by temporarily stopping the release of an egg from the ovary, preventing fertilization if ovulation has already occurred, or, if an egg has already been fertilized, preventing it from attaching to the wall of the uterus.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h4>Effectiveness</h4>
                    <p>The sooner you take Plan B®, the more effective it is. It can prevent pregnancy if taken within 72 hours and preferably within 12 hours of unprotected sex. If you take it within 24 hours of unprotected sex, it is 95% effective. If you take it between 48 and 72 hours of unprotected sex, the efficacy rate is 61%. Note that if Plan B® is used on more than one occasion, the cumulative pregnancy rate will be higher.</p>
                    <p>There is some data that levonorgestrel (the main ingredient in Plan B®) may be less effective in women with increasing weight or higher BMI (usually over 165 pounds).</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h4>What to do with birth control pills?</h4>
                    <p>If you’ve taken Plan B® because of missed birth control pills, start your birth control pills right away and remember to use another method of contraception, such as condoms, until your birth control is fully reliable again.</p>
